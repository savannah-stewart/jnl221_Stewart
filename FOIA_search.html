		<section>
			<p>I would be interested in looking at visitation to art museums in Syracuse. This would include patterns, duration, reason for visiting, and even financial statistics as it relates to visitors' spending habits. I could look at resources like the Syracuse Convention Visitors Bureau, Visit Syracuse, the American Alliance of Musuems, and other agencies that may provide necessary information for this subject.</p>
