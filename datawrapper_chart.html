		<!-- STEP ONE: Add an introduction to your dataviz here, and what story it will be a part of. -->
		<section>
			<p>Grocery stores Washington, DC's 8 Wards have experienced openings and closures depending on resource allocation, class, race and politics. This analysis of DC's open grocery stores in 2025 shows a divide in the region. While most wards currently maintain at least 10 operational stores, Wards 7 and 8 fall behind. Data shows the onging conern about gaps in food access in the District.</p>

		<!-- STEP FOUR: Add the feedback you got from your partner here. -->
		<section>
			<p>My partner shared that the chart is simple and not confusing. However, he shared that while the finding is later in the headline, it is clear when a reader gets to it. He also said that the subheadline is a little long but still highlights why the finding is important. Other aspects of the chart he hoped could be edited were organzing the data by number of stores, rather than ward number, and changing the "yes" and "no" axis labels to be more defined.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP FIVE: Add the iframe for your updated chart here. Replace the entire iframe below, from <iframe... to </script> -->
		<iframe title="Open Grocery Stores in 2025: A Stark Gap for DC's Wards 7 and 8" aria-label="Stacked Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-IkxXi" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IkxXi/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="386" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});
	</script>

		<!-- STEP SIX: Explain what you changed on your chart here, and why. -->
		<section>
			<p>On my chart, I changed the order of my headline to mention Wards 7 and 8 earlier so their importance was better clarified and viewers could immediately take note of the specific data points. I also edited the subheadline to make it more succinct. For example, I removed the mention of the Anancostia River because many people outside of th DC area are not aware of that waterway and its significance as it relates to food access and security in Washington. Lastly, I rearranged the actual bars in the chart so 7 and 8, the main data points, were the first mentions.</p>
