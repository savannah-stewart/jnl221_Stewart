			<p>https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::bias-crime/explore?showTable=true. This data is organized by the central complaint number (CCN), the block or location, date of offense, time of offense, date offense was recorded, report year, report month, police district, ward, type of hate or bias, targeted group, top offense type, master address repository identifier and the date information was last updated for each entry. It also includes the exact x, y, latitude and longitude coordinates. The data, which is updated on the 15th of each month, is collected through a process in which the Metropolitan Police Department reviews crimes identified as having been motivated by bias or hate. Using the Bias-Related Crime Act of 1989, this data explores bias crime in Washington, DC to “address allegations of crimes, but also to proactively educate the public about hate crimes,” according to the Bias Crime Summary on opendata.dc.gov. This data is newsworthy as the District of Columbia continues to face the impacts of President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops and control of the Metropolitan Police Department, which began in August. It provides context to locations where hate or bias crimes have been historically frequent and could be used to compare, and contrast what the occurrence of hate crimes look like in today’s changing political and social landscape. At the local level, good audiences for this story would be neighborhood associations and civil rights organizations. At the government level, audiences for this data could be council members and law enforcement agencies. One data hypothesis could be bias crime incidents concentrate in the District’s more affluent wards.</p>

This data is organized by section block lot number (SBL), property address, zip code, whether the property is a locally protected site (LPSS), whether the property is listed on the National Registry for Historic Places, along with latitude and longitude points. This data is collected by Syracuse’s Landmark Preservation Board. This data is newsworthy as Syracuse is currently experiencing a housing shortage due to burned vacant houses. According to a 2024 City Auditor report, 87% of house fires were in vacant buildings that are now unhabitable. Moreover, the potential to rebuild the structures does not align with current zoning codes. This data may help to provide context to and arguments for a reassessment for an allocation of funding for the city’s historic buildings, along with a heat map of areas which high concentrations of historic structures that are most affected by the burned home housing crisis. One data hypothesis could be certain property types, such as churches or public buildings, are more likely to receive historic designation than others.</p>
