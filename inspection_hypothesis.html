		<section>
			<p>A hypothesis that could come from <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Onondaga-County-Restaurant-Inspections/tbxv-5tbd/about_data" target="_blank">this</a> dataset is that Onondaga County's restaurants located in lower-income zip codes tend to have higher rates of total recorded critical violations than restaurants placed in the county's more affluent neighborhoods. This is a newsworthy hypothesis because it can be example of health disparities faced by some of the most vulnerable citizens of Onondaga County. Restaurants with more violations may be in areas burdened by a lack of economic resources and competition. This, in turn, may cause some restaurant owners to cut corners to combat financial stress, but ultimately put the health of those living in surrounding areas at risk. </p>
