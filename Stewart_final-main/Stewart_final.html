			<h3>A Glimpse Into Food Insecurity and Grocery Access in the Nation’s Capital</h3>

			<p>In Washington, DC, food insecurity remains an obstacle for many of the region's residents. According to <a href="https://unitedwaynca.org/food-insecurity-dc/" target="_blank">United Way of the National Capital Area</a>, the root causes of this issue can be attributed to barriers including but not limited to high costs of living, generational inequities and economic and social instability.</p>
			<p>However, food insecurity is inconsistent across DC, with racial disparities and geographical placement determining each Washingtonian’s relationship with basic needs. Most notably, Wards 7 and 8 historically and continue to most often feel the impact. In a study conducted by <a href="https://www.dchunger.org/hunger-in-dc/" target="_blank">D.C. Hunger Solutions</a>, researchers reported that “Black, Latinx, and other communities of color are shown to be more food insecure when compared to white households in D.C.” as of April 2021.</p>
			<p>Abby Fenton, Chief Advancement Officer at Capital Area Food Bank, oversees the organization’s philanthropic, fundraising and communications efforts, as well as the food bank’s community engagement team, covering volunteerism to food drives. She shared that she and her team at Capital Area Food Bank understand that there are eight wards in the city, yet six have significantly more access to fresh, nutritious food than Wards 7 and 8.</p>
			<p>“There's plenty of corner markets and bodega situations, but when you think about that fresh food, when you think about the colorful plate, that's harder to come by in those two wards,” she said.</p>
			<p>Recent data on DC’s grocery store locations from the Office of the Chief Technology Officer through Open Data DC shows that between Wards 7 and 8 there are eight grocery stores, yet only six are operational as of 2025. This greatly differs from a Ward like 2, where 14 grocery stores are operational out of 18. UWNCA cited that a limited number of grocery stores classify these two wards as food deserts, as they house over 80% of the city’s food deserts.</p>

			<p>This past April, in the early days of the <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/workforce-restructuring/reductions-in-force-rif/" target="_blank">Reduction in Force</a>, CAFB conducted outreach through special distributions in Wards 7 and 8 for government workers, housekeepers, contractors and other working populations experiencing the most pressure. While Fenton was boots-on-the-ground during the initiative, she said she was shocked by the number of people who traveled on foot to grocery stores.</p>
			<p>For day-to-day residents, Fenton said DC’s transportation systems in Wards 7 and 8 are rarely close enough to grocery stores or established, food-providing storefronts. In Ward 8, for example, Metro lines are often not in a reasonable proximity to a Safeway or Giant. So, Fenton suggested adapting to current behaviors in transporting items. This was accomplished through providing bags to be held in hands and placed on shoulders so fewer people would feel inclined to determine groceries provided by CAFB to keep or leave, since one bag could rarely suffice.</p>
